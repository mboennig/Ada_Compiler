# Ada_Compiler
The compiler takes source code writen in Ada and produces compiled code. A sample of this compiled code can be seen in *simple.out*. The compiler seperates the Ada code into tokens, then parses these tokens and puts them into code trees. The compiler makes basic syntax checks. This compiler does not handle the full Ada langauge, but it does handle a large subset of it (see below).
